    <h1>Welcome to a site by Agas!</h1>
    <h2>Simple Header</h2>
    <p>In this site, you can look through the several elements I often like to use in my sites and you can even find more about my way of writing code by simply right-clicking and clicking "Inspect" or simply press Ctrl + Shift + I on Chrome.</p>
    <h2 style="color: red;">Sample Header</h2>
    <p>See what I did there? I changed colors!</p>
    <p style="color: yellow;">Here's more colors to see.</p>
    <p style="color: purple;">And more.</p>
    <p style="color: green;">Such range is endless.</p>
    <p>And by endless, I mean 256<sup>3</sup> different colors to choose.</p>
    <h1 style="color: white;">I guess that's it.</h1>
